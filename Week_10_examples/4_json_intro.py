''' JSON = Javascript Object Notation
    Language agnostic standardized format
    for information storage and exchange.
    JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand.
    We can store data of a key-value nature.

#Python has a built-in package for reading and writing json

''' JSON looks a lot like Python:
Python  	           JSON
dictionary    	       object
list, tuple    	       array
'string' 	          "string"
int, float 	           number
True 	               true
False 	               false
None 	               null
