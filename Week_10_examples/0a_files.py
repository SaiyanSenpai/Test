'''
A Computer file is a basic storage unit.
File types include documents, images, videos etc.

Files are stored in folders (directories).
Files have names -> filename.extension
The file extension tells the user and the computerâ€™s
operating system what type of file it is
(what program should be used to open it?).

Files can be broadly separated into 2 categories:
text & binary

Text files -human readable in a text editor.
examples- .py .txt .html .json .write_csv

Binary Files -computer readable by an application
examples: .jpg, .mp3, .exe

The basic operations we can perform on files are
create, read, update & delete (crud).

Programmers spend a considerable amount of time working
with files.
